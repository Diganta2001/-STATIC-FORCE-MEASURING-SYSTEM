# -STATIC-FORCE-MEASURING-SYSTEM
Force measurement is a fundamental aspect of scientific research 
and engineering applications, essential for understanding and 
characterizing the physical world. Whether in material testing, 
structural analysis, or product design, the ability to accurately
measure and quantify forces is critical. A static force measuring 
system is designed to assess forces at rest, offering precise data for 
various scientific and engineering endeavors.
This introduction outlines the significance and purpose of building 
a static force measuring system using an experimental setup. It 
highlights the importance of force measurement, introduces the key 
components of the experimental setup, and provides a glimpse into 
the objectives of this project.
